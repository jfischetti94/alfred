Feature: Assignment approved/disapproved column
  As a teacher
  I want to see one more column on the page practical work
  To know the total amount approved and how many students are deprecated.  


  Background:
    Given the course with teacher and student enrolled 
    And there is a bunch of assignment already created

  Scenario: assignment without solutions submitted
    Given there are solutions submitted by students
      And I am logged in as teacher 
    And   I follow "Trabajos pr√°cticos"
    Then  I should see "0/0/0"
